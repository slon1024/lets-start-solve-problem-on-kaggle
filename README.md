# Let's start solve ~~problems~~ challenges on Kaggle
This is presentation/training prepared for [DataKRK](http://www.meetup.com/datakrk/events/225441503/).
I'll be happy if it help you start solve challenges on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) :smile:!

## How to start use it?
1. `git clone https://github.com/slon1024/lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle`
2. `cd lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle`
3. `git fetch`

After this you will have all three steps (in different branches, initial step is on the `master`).

1. Step 1 is on the branch `step1` (`git checkout step1`)  
2. Step 2 is on the branch `step2` (`git checkout step2`)  
3. Step 3 is on the branch `step3` (`git checkout step3`)  

## Quick review scripts
*Note: github allowing you do a qucik review  (of course readonly). For bigger scripts this works very slowwwwly.*

1. [Step 0 (initial step)](https://github.com/slon1024/lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle/blob/master/bike-sharing-demand.ipynb)
2. [Step 1 (improve evaluation a model)](https://github.com/slon1024/lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle/blob/step1/bike-sharing-demand.ipynb)
3. [Step 2 (understand better data and improve a model)](https://github.com/slon1024/lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle/blob/step2/bike-sharing-demand.ipynb)
4. [Step 3(feature engineering and tuning model)](https://github.com/slon1024/lets-start-solve-problem-on-kaggle/blob/step3/bike-sharing-demand.ipynb)


I recommend to you follow step by step.  
*If you have any questions or ideas, please let me know.*
